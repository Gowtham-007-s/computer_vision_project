Built a real-time computer vision system that detects facial emotions and user attention using a webcam.
🔹 Emotion classification (7 classes)
🔹 Facial landmark & eye-tracking for attention analysis
🔹 Real-time processing
🛠 Tech stack: Python | OpenCV | TensorFlow | Keras | MediaPipe | NumPy
This project gave me hands-on experience with deep learning deployment, real-world debugging, and computer vision systems.
Excited to keep building in AI & Computer Vision 🚀
